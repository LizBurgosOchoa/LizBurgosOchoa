I am an applied statistician and PhD candidate at the Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam (Erasmus MC) working on health inequalities, with a particular emphasis on the neighbourhood environment. I have a backgorund in Psychology and in 2018 I obtained my masterâ€™s degree in Methods and Statistics for the Behavioral, Biomedical, and Social Sciences at Utrecht University. 

My interests are: Methodology and statistics, causal inference with observational data, mediation analysis, health inequalities, and neighbourhood effects. I am very passionate about research, data analysis and data visualization.
